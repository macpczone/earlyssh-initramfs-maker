### Early SSH Initramfs Maker

This repo contains a script that can make an initramfs, which can be used to boot up a LUKS encrypted hard drive, with only a network connection. I spent a bit of time looking for a solution to boot a Centos 6 server that I am using, while having the main drive encrypted on a headless box. I found some solutions that added a module to dracut, but they involved replacing the console cryptsetup password prompt with an ssh only version. This is a bit inconvenient because I will sometimes want to attach a keyboard and monitor to this server, so I decided to create my own version without dracut, that allows the password to both be entered from the console and from the ssh connection as well.
